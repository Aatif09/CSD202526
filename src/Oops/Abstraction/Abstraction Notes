Introduction
Abstraction is a concept of :
hiding internal implementation details and showing only the essential features to the user.

Real World Example
When you drive a car, you only need to know how to operate the steering wheel, pedals and gear shift. You don't need to understand how the engine works or how the brakes are designed.
James Gosling
How to achieve Abstraction :-
We can achieve Abstraction by two ways:
1.Using Abstract Classes
2.Using Interfaces

Abstract Methods :-
Introduction
An abstract method is a method that is declared without an implementation (no method body).
It only provides the method signature and forces subclasses to provide the actual implementation.
Declared using the abstract keyword.
Syntax & Example :
Syntax : abstract returnType methodName(parameters);
Example : abstract void makeSound(); // Abstract method – no body

Rules of Abstract Method :
No method body – ends with a semicolon (;).
Must be declared inside an abstract class or interface.
A class that contains an abstract method must be declared abstract.
Abstract methods must be overridden by subclasses, unless the subclass is also abstract.
Cannot be private, static or final — because it must be overridden.

Abstract Class :-
Introduction
An abstract class in Java is a class that is declared using the abstract keyword.
It can contain a mix of abstract methods (without body) and concrete methods (with body).
It cannot be instantiated (you cannot create objects of it).
